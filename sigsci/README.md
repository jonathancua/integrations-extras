## Setup

To use the Signal Sciences-Datadog integration, you must be a customer of Signal Sciences. For more information about Signal Sciences, visit us at <https://www.signalsciences.com>.

### Configuration

#### Metrics Collection

1. Install the [Signal Sciences agent][8].

2. Configure the Signal Sciences agent to use DogStatsD:

    Add the following line to each agent's agent.config file:
    ```
    statsd-type = "dogstatsd"
    ```

    When this is done the agent's StatsD client has tagging enabled and metrics such as `sigsci.agent.signal.<SIGNAL_TYPE>` are sent as `sigsci.agent.signal` and tagged with `signal_type:<SIGNAL_TYPE>`.

    *Example:*`sigsci.agent.signal.http404` => `sigsci.agent.signal` with tag `signal_type:http404`
    
    If using Kubernetes to run the Datadog Agent, make sure to enable DogStatsD non local traffic as described in the [Kubernetes DogStatsD documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/kubernetes/dogstatsd/).

3. Configure the SigSci agent to send metrics to the Datadog Agent:

    Add the following line to each agent's `agent.config` file:
    ```
    statsd-address="<DATADOG_AGENT_HOSTNAME>:<DATADOG_AGENT_PORT>"
    ```

4. Click the button to install the integration.

5. In Datadog, verify that the "Signal Sciences - Overview" dashboard is created and starting to capture metrics.

#### Events Collection

1. Within Datadog, [create an API key][2].

2. In your [Signal Sciences Dashboard][3] on the Site navigation bar, click Manage > Integrations and click Add next to the Datadog Event integration.

3. Enter the API Key in the _API Key_ field.

4. Click _Add_.
